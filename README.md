# Password Manager Web Application

This project is a full-stack password manager web application designed to help users generate, store, and evaluate the strength of their passwords. Built using TypeScript, this application leverages the power of Google Firebase Studio for robust backend services and the Gemini API for advanced security features, including password strength evaluation.

**Key Features:**

*   **Password Generation:** Generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria.
*   **Secure Storage:** Securely stores user passwords using Firebase's backend infrastructure.
*   **Password Strength Evaluation:** Employs the Gemini API to analyze and assess the strength of user-generated passwords, providing feedback on potential weaknesses.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers an intuitive and accessible interface for managing passwords.

**Technical Highlights:**

*   **Full-Stack Development:** This is a complete full-stack project, encompassing both frontend and backend development.
*   **TypeScript:** The entire application is built using TypeScript, ensuring type safety and code maintainability.
*   **Google Firebase Studio:** Utilizes Firebase services for backend functionality, including database management and authentication.
*   **Gemini API Integration:** Integrates with the Gemini API to provide advanced password security analysis.

**Project Structure:**
